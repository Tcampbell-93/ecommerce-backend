## Description
In this project I set up the routes and models for a sequelize backend server. This project taught me a lot about how to use sequelize and create models and relationships. 

## Installation 
You will need to install the following dependencies.
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mysql2": "^2.1.0",
    "sequelize": "^5.21.7"
    
devDependencies:
    "nodemon": "^2.0.3"

## Usage
In order to use the routes you will need to use insomnia. You will have to create a .env file and add DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD with your mysql credentials. First open the command line and create the database with mysql. Then in the command line use "npm run seed" to seed the database. Next you must start the server with "npm start" in the command line. From there you can use insomnia to use each of the routes defined in the api file.
